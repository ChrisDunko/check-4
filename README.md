# Check v4
Simple tasklist(s) app that stores lists and items only in local storage, no data is transmitted to a server during usage.

## Technologies
* JavaScript (compiled to ES6)
* TypeScript 4
* Vue 3
* Vue-Router 4
* Pinia 2
* Vite

and of course
* HTML 5
* CSS 3

Check 4 is a SPA (Single Page Application) that means that there are no page reloads but only asynchronous calls and / or operations.

Since I don't use SSR (Server Side Rendering) in this project the Search Engine friendliness is as bad as it gets. User typically don't want to find their shopping cards on Duck Duck Go so that shouldn't be an issue.

You can either host the app on your own server or use it as a SaaS (Software as a Service) at [check4.dunkake.ch](https://check4.dunkake.ch).

I mainly created this app to get comfortable with typescripted Vuex 4 stores (and I really needed a electronic shopping list app).

I hope you enjoy reading my code and / or using the app and I would be more that happy if you have constructive criticism or are even willing to contribute in code!
